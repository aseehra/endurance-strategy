# Endurance Strategy Reporter

Endurance Strategy Reporter brings detailed post-race analysis straight to your
fingertips.

## Try it out
[Demo version](https://endurance-strategy.herokuapp.com/)

## Motivation
ESR helps fans who find the strategy of an endurance sportscar race equally (if
not more) fascinating than the whee-to-wheel action on track. While most race
series provide live timing services, they are not available after a race. ESR
allows users to browse through previous races and see critical strategy
information such as pit stop times, fuel & tire stints, along with average and best lap times.

## Features

- Browse previous races
- Search for the team, driver or car number you're interested in
- Statistics for each entry
  - Fastest driver
  - Best laps per driver
  - Pit stop times
  - Stint lengths with average and best laps per stint

## Future work
The eventual goal of this project is to connect to a live-timing service and
provide real-time analysis of a race-in-progress. Additionally, improving the
quality of the statistics provided (including adding lap charts) are left for
future iterations.

## Questions? Problems?

### Installation
#### Requirements
- [Endurance Strategy Reporter API server](https://github.com/aseehra/endurance-strategy-server)
- Node.js

#### Instructions

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
$ REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=<URL for your backend instance> serve -s build
```

#### Heroku

This project uses React Create App, and as such you should use the
[create-react-app-buildpack](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack):

- For a new heroku app:
```bash
$ heroku create <APP NAME> --buildpack mars/create-react-app
```
- For an existing app:
```bash
$ heroku buildpacks:set mars/create-react-app
```

## Key components
- [`EntryDetails.jsx`](https://github.com/aseehra/endurance-strategy/blob/master/src/containers/EntryDetails/EntryDetails.jsx)
  is the component that drives the display of a race entry's statistics.
- [`entries.js`](https://github.com/aseehra/endurance-strategy-server/blob/master/src/db/entries.js)
  is where the statistical analyses are calculated. This includes deriving stint
  data from stored pit-stop information.
